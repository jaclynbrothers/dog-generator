## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on making a simple design that was easy for a user to understand and use.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would create an alternative version for dogs that are waiting to be adopted. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to access the Dog CEO API to retrieve data on all available breeds and have it work in tandem with various arrays.
